# List Comprehensions

**Task**

Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers x, y and z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer . Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to n. Here, 0<=i<=x; 0<=j<=y; 0<=k<=z. Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.

**Input Format**

Four integers x, y, z and n, each on a separate line.

**Constraints**

Print the list in lexicographic increasing order.
